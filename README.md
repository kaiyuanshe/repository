## Members

We have a [members](members) directory, each member could create a file named by his/her github account 
under the `members` directory.
All the detailed introduction could be put under his/her own directory. 

## How to add your repository

By open a [PR](github.com/kaiyuanshe/pulls)
- fork this project
- add a `members/yourself` directory and add all the logo and documents user that
- append a summary to the project list at the beginning of this file
```
* [yourproject](project address)
```
- create a PR

We need to have better rule to organize and display all members' repositories in this `README.md`,
so any suggestion is welcomed. 

## How to maintain

All maintainers should follow this [GUILD](MAINTAINERS_GUILD.md), a maintainer role is gained by contribution.
The initial maintainers are Kuaiyuanshe's members of the council.
