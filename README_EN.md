## Members Directory

We have a [members](members) directory, each member could create a directory named by his/her github account 
under the `members` directory.
All the detailed introduction could be put under his/her own directory. 
We provide a [template](members/template) for reference.

## How to add your repository

**By open a [PR](https://github.com/kaiyuanshe/pulls)**
- fork this project
- add a `members/yourself` directory and add all the logo and documents under it
- append a summary to the project list at the beginning of this file in ascending order
```
* [yourproject](project address)
```
- create a PR

We need to have a better template and a better rule to organize and display all members' repositories in this `README.md`,
any suggestion is welcomed. 

## How to maintain

All maintainers should follow this [GUIDE](MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md), a maintainer role is gained by contribution.
The initial maintainers are Kuaiyuanshe's members of the council.
